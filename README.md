# Getting and Cleaning Data - Assignment 4

## Introduction

The `run_analysis.R` script allows to download the SAMSUNG data (folder, or archive) used in assignment 4 and tidies it.

The script simply takes the SAMSUNG data as input (through variables) and outputs 2 txt files containing the tidies data.

Only sourcing the script is required to perform those operations.

By default the data folder should be located inside the `data` folder (created if missing) and the outputs are created inside a `tidy` folder.

```R
source("./run_analysis.R")
```
